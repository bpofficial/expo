# API Design

The foundational set of Expo APIs are those that are maintained by the Expo team. This allows us to ensure that the APIs continue to work well with Expo and are coherently designed with a longer-term vision.

## Audited APIs

This is the list of APIs that have been audited. One aspect of this is that the APIs have been approved by @ide and @esamelson. The approximate date the API was last reviewed is included to more easily tell how much time has passed and if the API is still likely to be in an approved state.

| API | Owner | Review Date | Notes |
| --- | ----- | ----------- | ----- |
| Brightness | Eric | 2018 | |
| Screen Orientation | Quin | 2018 | Some open issues; some issues on web |
| Device | James | August 2019 | |
| Application | James | August 2019 | |
| Battery | James | August 2019 | Android implementation needs work |
