# expo-file-system

`expo-file-system` provides access to a file system stored locally on the device. Each Expo app has a separate file systems and has no access to the file system of other Expo apps. The API takes `file://` URIs pointing to local files on the device to identify files.

See [FileSystem docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem) for documentation of this universal module's API.
