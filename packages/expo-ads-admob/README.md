# expo-ads-admob

`expo-ads-admob` provides support for the [Google AdMob SDK](https://www.google.com/admob/) for mobile advertising. This module is largely based of the [react-native-admob](https://github.com/sbugert/react-native-admob) module, as the documentation and questions surrounding that module may prove helpful. A simple example implementing AdMob SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/deadcoder0904/expo-google-admob).

See [AdMob docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/admob) for documentation of this universal module's API.
