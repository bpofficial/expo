# expo-ads-admob

Provides support for the Google AdMob SDK (https://www.google.com/admob/) for mobile advertising. This module is largely based of the react-native-admob (https://github.com/sbugert/rea ct-native-admob) module, as the documentation and questions surrounding that module may prove helpful. A simple example implementing AdMob SDK can be found at https://github.com/deadcoder0904/expo-goo gle-admob
