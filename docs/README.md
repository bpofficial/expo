# Exponent Documentation

Hi! This is what will make Exponent actually be useable by people. :)

## How to edit

### As a random person

Thanks for helping! :D Just make your changes on a fork of this repository or
whatever works for you and submit a pull request. We'll take a look and
incorporate them!

### As an Exponent developer

Make your changes in `universe/docs` and commit them. When our `shipit` bot
synchronizes the changes to the public `exponent-docs` repository, a webhook
will run that regenerates the HTML to display on the documentation website. All
you need to do is commit!
