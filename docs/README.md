# Exponent Documentation

Hi! This is what will make Exponent actually be useable by people. :)

## How to edit

### As a random person

Thanks for helping! :D Just make your changes on a fork of this repository or
whatever works for you and submit a pull request. We'll take a look and
incorporate them!

### As an Exponent developer

Make your changes in universe and commit them. Then, at the root of universe,
run `git subrepo push docs`. This will push to the public repository, which
triggers a webhook that rebuilds the documentation (generating the online
version, pdf and epub) automatically.
