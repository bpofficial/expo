**EAS Builds** is a service for building app binaries for your React Native project. You can take advantage of it for both managed and bare Expo projects. This service is going to replace the existing build service entirely.

## Discover EAS Builds

- [Setup](../setup/) - Setup the environment to get started with EAS Builds.
- [Configuring with eas.json](../eas-json/) - Learn about configuring your build workflows with the `eas.json` file.

- [Advanced Credentials Configuration](../advanced-credentials-configuration/) - Use your existing app's credentials or streamline the CI build process with `credentials.json`.

## Managed Project Limitation

Building managed Expo projects is **not** supported yet but we are working on bringing it to EAS Builds! If you wish to build a managed Expo project, you'll have to eject it first. See the [Ejecting to Bare Workflow](../../workflow/customizing/) page to learn how to do it.
