title: Hello World

To get started with a bare React Native project, run `expo init` and choose one of the bare templates. We'll use the minimum template here. This guide assumes that you have Xcode and/or Android Studio installed and working.

```bash
# If you don't have expo-cli yet, get it
npm i -g expo-cli
# If you don't have react-native-cli yet, get it
npm i -g react-native-cli
# This is a shortcut to skip the UI for picking the template
expo init --template bare-minimum
```

Next, let's get the project running. Go into your project directory and run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` &mdash; hurray! Your project is working.

## Using @unimodules/core

Bare template projects come with `@unimodules/core` installed and configured. This package gives you access to some commonly useful APIs, like `Asset`, `Constants`, `FileSystem`, and `Permissions`. You can import these from `@unimodules/core` like so:

```js
import { Asset, Constants, FileSystem, Permissions } from '@unimodules/core';
```

## Install a Unimodule

We're going to install [`expo-web-browser`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-web-browser), it's a useful little package for showing a modal web browser using the appropriate native APIs on each platform.

```bash
npm install expo-web-browser
```

Open up `App.js` and add a button that, when pressed, opens up a web browser. Here's some code for you.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <Button
          title="Open a web browser"
          onPress={() => {
            WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync('https://expo.io');
          }}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

This will not yet work because we haven't linked the native code that powers it. To do this, we need to follow the instructions in the [`expo-web-browser` README](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-web-browser) to configure it for iOS and Android. Let's do it.

### iOS configuration

The iOS side is easiest, so let's do it first. Bare projects are initialized using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), a dependency manager for iOS projects. If you don't have Cocoapods installed already, [install it](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). Now let's go into `ios/Podfile` and add `pod 'EXWebBrowser', path: '../node_modules/expo-web-browser/ios'` on a new line after `use_unimodules!`. Close the file and run `pod install` in the `ios` directory. Now you can run `react-native run-ios` again from the root of the project and it should work as expected!

### Android configuration

There's not much context needed beyond what the README says here, just follow the steps below:

1. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

```gradle
include ':expo-web-browser'
project(':expo-web-browser').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/expo-web-browser/android')
```

2. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
api project(':expo-web-browser')
```

3. In `MainApplication.java`, import the package and add it to the `ReactModuleRegistryProvider` list:
```java
import expo.modules.expo.modules.webbrowser.WebBrowserPackage;
```
```java
private final ReactModuleRegistryProvider mModuleRegistryProvider = new ReactModuleRegistryProvider(Arrays.<Package>asList(
  // Your other packages will be here
  new WebBrowserPackage()
), Arrays.<SingletonModule>asList());
```
Now go ahead and run `react-native run-android`. Press the button, watch the browser open. Success! Happy times.

## What now?

Most of the Expo APIs are available in bare React Native projects and can be installed using a process very similar to the above. Go ahead and browser the `API Reference` section and follow the installation instructions linked to there, then read the API documentation and ejoy. Good luck building your app!
