<p>Exponent is a mobile app development tool that enables you to build high
  quality native iOS and Android applications using JavaScript and deploy
  them effortlessly.
</p>
<p>Writing an Exponent app is like writing a React Native app, except you
  never need to open Xcode / Android Studio, or write any native code. To
  make this possible, we have built <a class="reference external" href="sdk/index.html">a collection of native APIs into
  Exponent</a> which you can access through the <cite>exponent</cite>
  npm package. These native APIs include functionality like Facebook
  login, an image picker/cropper and push notifications. We're continually
  adding to our native APIs and would like to hear from you if there's
  something that we're missing: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support@getexponent.com">support<span>@</span>getexponent<span>.</span>com</a>.
</p>
<p>Exponent also provides UI components to handle a variety of use-cases
  that almost all apps will cover but are not baked into React Native
  core, these include icons, an image lightbox, a loading overlay and
  more.
</p>
<p>So go ahead and give Exponent a try, follow the <a class="reference
  external" href="introduction/installation.html">Installation</a>
  instructions -- it shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Once you're done
  with that, get <a class="reference external" href="guides/up-and-running.html">Up and Running</a>
  with your first Exponent project.  If you're not already familiar with React and React Native
  you can bootstrap your knowledge with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/">React Native Express</a>.
