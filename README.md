Expo is a set of tools, libraries, and services that let you build native iOS and Android apps by writing JavaScript. This repository is where the Expo client software is developed, and includes the client apps, modules, apps, and more.

[Click here to view the Expo Community Guidelines](https://expo.io/guidelines). Thank you for helping keep the Expo community open and welcoming!

## üó∫ Project Layout

- `packages` All the source code for the Unimodules, if you want to edit a library or just see how it works this is where you'll find it.
- `apps` This is where you can find Expo projects which are linked to the development Unimodules. You'll do most of your testing in here.
- `docs` The source code for **https://docs.expo.io**
- `templates` The template projects you get when you run `expo start`
- `react-native-lab` This is our fork of `react-native`. We keep this very close to the upstream but sometimes need to add quick fixes locally before they can land.
- `guides` In-depth tutorials for our most advanced topics like contributing to the client.
- `android` contains the Android project.
- `home` contains the JavaScript source code of the app.
- `ios` contains the iOS project.
- `ios/Exponent.xcworkspace` is the Xcode workspace. Always open this instead of `Exponent.xcodeproj` because the workspace also loads the CocoaPods dependencies.
- `tools-public` contains build and configuration tools.
- `template-files` contains templates for files that require private keys. They are populated using the keys in `template-files/keys.json`.
- `template-files/ios/dependencies.json` specifies the CocoaPods dependencies of the app.
